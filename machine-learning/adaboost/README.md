# AdaBoost

## Goals

1. To implement the AdaBoost algorithm.
2. Results analysis.

## Task

Examine and implement the adaptive binning algorithm for the classification task with exponential loss function (AdaBoost). Use the solution tree as the basic algorithm.

Imagine how the algorithm classifies the entire space after 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and 55 bubbling steps. Create a graph of the quality dependence on the step number. Use accuracy as a quality function.

You are also allowed to use `sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier` in this lab work.

## Data Sets

Use `chips.csv` and `geyser.csv` data sets to test your classifier.
