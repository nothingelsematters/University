# Homework 7

> Goal: to gain practical experience in using aspects and AOS.

Write a profiler for your application. The profiler should be implemented in the Aspect oriented paradigm. The profiler must allow:

* choose the package whose classes you want to profile
* calculate how many times each method was called
* calculate average and total method execution time

The advantage is that the profiling results can be easily visualized (e.g. in tree-like structure)

Instructions:

* You can use spring aop or aspectJ for java.
* You can also use other AOP frameworks (including other languages)
