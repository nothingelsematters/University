# Cryptography

## Symmetric Ciphers

+ [Kasiski examination](kasiski-examination): hacking Vigenere cipher
+ [des cipher](des) (Data Encryption Standard)
+ [serpent cipher](serpent): Advanced Encryption Standard contest second place

## Stream Ciphers

+ [rc4](rc4): simpliest stream cipher

---

+ [comp128](comp128): implementation of the A3 and A8 functions defined in the GSM standard

> A3 is used to authenticate the mobile station to the network. A8 is used to generate the session key used by A5 to encrypt the data transmitted between the mobile station and the BTS

## Assymmetric Ciphers

+ [rsa](rsa): simpliest modulo operation based assymmetric cipher
